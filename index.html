				My coaching experiences</h3>

				<p class="justifier">
				"As part of a project led by the BIAT Foundation (International Arab Bank of Tunisia) for youth, I volunteered in humanitarian action during 2017 for a period of three months every Saturday. This consisted of supervising in learning, children from disadvantaged backgrounds in remote regions of Tunisia. As for me, I gave a few French lessons as well as some basic math lessons to a group of young students. This action immediately struck me when I heard about it, it allowed the underprivileged youth of the country to have access to a minimum of education. This experience allowed me to realize that some young people were motivated by the idea of ​​learning but that their financial means did not allow it. The fight against inequality in education prompted me to participate in this humanitarian action because for me every child deserves to have access to education regardless of their social background. I think that only educated and cultivated youth can allow a country like Tunisia to develop."</p>

				My civic engagement</h3>
				
				<p class="justifier">
				"I was part of the Unesco Club of Lycée Pierre Mendès France with which I participated in many actions of all kinds. These actions had only been carried out within the establishment, mainly through awareness raising campaigns. Of all the actions, one really stood out; it was our campaign to fight violence against women. From posters to dancing, speeches to song, it was very touching for me to see the investment our group has shown. It was the experience that made me realize that I was helping to change mentalities. Finally this club made me mature and showed me that I too could leave my mark on this earth and this is the most important. In my future, I would like to have a constant reminder of humility such as Unesco, in order to never forget that union is the force !"</p>

				My professional experience</h3>
				
				<p class="justifier">
				"During my schooling, I did many internships in a field that interests me particularly : finance. Indeed, in 2015,I decided to carry out my first internship in a stock market intermediary called Cofib Capital Finances. I really enjoyed this internship and that allowed me to confirm my future direction. Therefore, I was much more interested in this field and had carried out in the years which followed, internships in stock exchange intermediary: two weeks in 2016 at MAC SA, two weeks in 2017 at Tunisie Valeurs and finally a month in 2018 at Cofib Capital Finances. Being already sure of my direction, I decided in 2018 in order to broaden my knowledge, to carry out a two-week internship in the Arab International Bank of Tunisia. On the other hand, the investment funds having intrigued me, in 2019 I completed a one-week internship at Maxula gestion. In addition, I participated to an entrepreneurship competition named Spark in 2017 and 2018. Finally all these internships have allowed me to acquire a lot of knowledge in the field and make it my passion."</p>

				My openness to the world</h3>

				<p class="justifier">
				"Sports and cultural practices are essential in my daily life. Since my childhood, I tested myself in several sports; I first did 4 years of swimming which revealed a real passion to me, then I played tennis for 2 years. This sport allowed me to refocus on my goals and above all it : to channel my energy. I must add that my curiosity drove me not to settle for just one sport. Indeed, I very quickly realized that I wanted to explore as much as possible; So I've been doing all kinds of physical activity over the past few years and I think I've found a healthy pace that works for me. Therefore  I maintain a healthy lifestyle, based on versatility and diversity. In fact, my curiosity is not exclusively sporting; it also punctuates my cultural interests. I am very interested in foreign cultures and religions because diversity and co-education are the values ​​I advocate on my daily life. I always make sure to know what's going on in our world : I read the newspapers and watch the news. In other words I want to be prepared for real life. Actually, where I really find refuge is music, I admire the fact that music succeeds where sometimes speech fails. In conclusion I would say that culture and personal development are the foundations of success, because without them we cannot maintain a healthy balance, they are visceral to me."</p>
